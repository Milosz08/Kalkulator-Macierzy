# Matrix Calculator

## Assumptions
Rectangular matrices, dynamically allocated memory, checking dimensions during operations, basic operations like addition subtraction, multiplication, calculation of determinant. In addition to basic matrix operations, you should: determine the inverse matrix, transposed matrix, etc. It is mandatory to use C++ templates.

## Supported mathematical operations
* Calculation of the “n” elementary matrix determinant (square matrices only),
* Calculation of the reversal matrix to the primary matrix (square matrices only),
* Calculation of the conjugated matrix on the primary matrix,
* Basic arithmetic actions (addition, subtraction, multiplication),
* Multiplication of the matrix by the scalar value,
* Transpose a matrix.

## Launch application
This application can be started from a file `PK_Matrix_Calculator.exe` is in the `/cmake-build-debug/PK_Matrix_Calculator.exe` directory. <br>
Full support for Windows 10 (v20H2) 64-bit.
